### Review Standard Content Quality

- [ ] **All Standards (1-10)**: Ensure rationales explicitly connect to MATL experience
- [ ] **Standards 4, 5, 8**: Strengthen connection between theory and practice
- [ ] **Standards 6, 7**: Include specific lesson plans and assessment tools as artifacts
- [ ] **Standards 1, 2, 3**: Strengthen differentiation/diverse learner adaptations

## 🟢 LOWER PRIORITY - Enhancement & Polish

### Add Academic Support Documentation

- [ ] **All Standards**: Add references to TESOL/ACTFL Standards where appropriate
  - Standard 4: Content Knowledge - reference ACTFL performance descriptors
  - Standard 5: Application of Content - reference ACTFL Can-Do Statements
  - Standard 6: Assessment - reference ACTFL assessment principles
  - Standard 8: Instructional Strategies - reference ACTFL communication modes

- [ ] **All Rationales**: Include citations to current SLA research/theory
  - Examples: Krashen's Input Hypothesis, Swain's Output Hypothesis, sociocultural theory

### Teaching Philosophy Page

- [ ] Verify teaching philosophy reflects familiarity with SLA theory
- [ ] Add explicit connections to MATL coursework
- [ ] Include references to language acquisition theories
- [ ] Connect philosophy to artifacts throughout portfolio

### Evidence of Research Engagement

- [ ] Identify/highlight artifacts that demonstrate engagement in research:
  - Action research project (already mentioned in Reflection 1)
  - Literature reviews from courses
  - Research papers or presentations
  - Analysis of classroom data

### Citations and Academic Register

- [ ] Review all rationales for appropriate academic discourse
- [ ] Ensure consistent citation style throughout (APA recommended for education)
- [ ] Add reference list/bibliography page for cited sources
- [ ] Check that all external sources are properly attributed

### Organization and Professional Presentation

- [ ] Add course information/metadata to artifact sections
  - Which MATL course each artifact came from
  - Semester/year completed
  - Assignment context

- [ ] Consider adding:
  - Table of Contents with direct links to each standard
  - "About This Portfolio" introductory page
  - Visual consistency across all pages (currently good)

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. **Complete missing artifact content** (Standards 1, 6-10)
2. **Add second artifacts** to Standards 2, 4, and 5
3. **Write actual reflection content** (3 reflection pages)
4. **Add TESOL/ACTFL Standards references** to all rationales
5. **Review teaching philosophy** for SLA theory connections
6. **Add course metadata** to all artifacts
7. **Create reference list** for cited sources
8. **Final review** for academic discourse and consistency

---

## 📊 Current Completion Status

**Standards Content:**
- ✅ Complete: Standards 3 (2 artifacts)
- ⚠️ Partial: Standards 2, 4, 5 (1 artifact each - need 2nd)
- ❌ Incomplete: Standards 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (lorem ipsum)

**Other Pages:**
- ✅ Complete: Home, About Me, Teaching Philosophy (structure), Resume
- ⚠️ Partial: Reflections landing page (structure complete, content needed)
- ❌ Incomplete: 3 reflection pages (placeholders only)

**Overall Estimate:** ~40% complete

**Target for "Exemplary Portfolio" (94-100 points):**
- Need exceptional rationales with deep SLA theory connections
- Need 2+ strong artifacts per standard (currently only Standard 3 meets this)
- Need completed research reflections
- Need consistent TESOL/ACTFL Standards integration

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Connect Everything to MATL**: Every artifact should reference which MATL course it came from
2. **Theory-Practice Bridge**: Each rationale should cite specific SLA theories and explain their application
3. **ACTFL/TESOL Throughout**: Reference these standards in every appropriate rationale
4. **Show Research Engagement**: Highlight action research, literature reviews, or classroom investigations
5. **Academic Voice**: Use formal academic register; avoid casual language
6. **Be Specific**: Include actual lesson plans, assessment rubrics, student work samples (anonymized)
