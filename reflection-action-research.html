          <p>
            Engaging in this action research project has been a meaningful and very challenging learning experience.
            Although the project focused on a small and specific goal, increasing students' use of Spanish during group
            work, it helped me rethink the interactional environment of my entire fourth-grade classroom. Before
            beginning the project, I believed that students' frequent switch to English was simply a habitual behavior
            of young learners. Through the reflective cycle of observing, intervening, and analyzing, I learned that the
            challenge was not about student willingness but about the instructional structures I had (or not) put in
            place.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the biggest insights from the project was understanding the power of predictability for novice
            learners. The prompt cards, greetings, roles, and closing routines provided a structure that students could
            rely on, especially when group interactions became unpredictable or socially demanding. This predictability
            lowered anxiety, encouraged participation, and helped students reach for Spanish even when they felt unsure.
            Watching students confidently use expressions like "No entiendo" and "¿Cómo se dice?", phrases they had
            avoided before, showed me that scaffolding matters just as much for communication skills as it does for
            content knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project also reshaped the way I think about classroom culture. I witnessed a genuine change when
            students began reminding each other, not just themselves, to use Spanish. It was no longer my expectation
            alone; it became our collective norm. That moment felt like a turning point as a teacher: the realization
            that routines can empower students to be responsible for their own learning and for each other. I could see
            Walsh's (2011) idea of the classroom as an interactional space come alive in a simple but powerful way.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a professional standpoint, this project strengthened my identity as a reflective teacher-researcher. It
            showed me that inquiry is not something separate from teaching; it is part of what makes teaching dynamic
            and responsive. The process helped me slow down, observe more deeply, question my assumptions, and collect
            meaningful evidence from my own students. Most importantly, it reminded me that improvement does not always
            require a major overhaul; sometimes, small, intentional adjustments can create the conditions for meaningful
            change.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key challenge during this project was managing the realities of a fourth-grade classroom while collecting
            consistent data. Group work often became unpredictable, and without student Chromebooks, I had to adjust my
            original plan and rely on printed supports and at-home materials instead of digital tools in class. Time
            constraints, short class periods and a busy schedule also made it tricky to implement each intervention step
            as planned. Even so, these challenges pushed me to be flexible, intentional, and more aware of how students
            actually use Spanish during collaborative work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving forward, I plan to continue using action research as a tool for growth. I want to explore how these
            routines might support more complex language tasks or how peer modeling could further develop student
            agency. This project also encouraged me to maintain a more consistent teaching journal so I can regularly
            notice patterns, questions, and areas of inquiry within my classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, this action research project affirmed my belief that effective teaching is built on reflection,
            curiosity, and a willingness to try new approaches. It helped me see my students differently, understand my
            practice more deeply, and recognize that I can shape classroom interaction in intentional, culturally
            responsive ways. It is a project I will carry forward not only as an artifact of my MATL portfolio but as a
            habit of mind that will continue to inform my teaching for years to come.
