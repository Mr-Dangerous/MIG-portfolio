              My journey as a language learner and a language teacher began long before I ever imagined standing in front of a classroom. My love of reading started at a young age. I enjoyed stories not only for their narratives but for their rhythm, images, and the unique voice each writer offered. Those early literary experiences taught me to appreciate the power of language as an artistic and expressive form. Without realizing it, I was already becoming a linguist.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Another passion that continues to shape both my worldview and my teaching is my love of history. I was always drawn to the lives of people who came before us, the cultures they created, and the stories that have been woven through time. History made me understand that languages are not isolated systems; they are the breath of civilizations, the record of human experience, and the bridge that connects us to the past and present. Learning about medieval Spain, Indigenous American cultures, the evolution of Spanish, and the movement of people across continents deepened my appreciation for languages and their cultural roots. Today, this historical curiosity inspires the cultural units I design for my classroom, from cantigas and sevillanas to Andean textiles and Caribbean rhythms.
          </p>

          <p>
            As I grew older, my love of languages naturally followed my love of reading and history. I was captivated by the ways different languages reflect the cultures that speak them, their folklore, their customs, and their worldview. This connection became even more real when my life changed dramatically: moving from Spain to the United States. Suddenly, language was both my greatest challenge and my greatest motivation. I arrived with limited English and experienced firsthand the vulnerability that comes with wanting to express yourself but lacking the linguistic tools. I struggled, observed, listened closely, made mistakes, and slowly learned to navigate a new world through a new tongue.
          </p>

          <p>
            Those early years as an immigrant shaped me profoundly. They taught me humility and empathy. They taught me that language learning is not linear; it is emotional, social, cognitive, and deeply personal. They taught me to recognize the courage of every student who walks into a classroom and tries to speak in a language that is not their own. This lived experience guides every pedagogical decision I make as a teacher.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of this personal history, I am deeply committed to creating a classroom where every student feels safe, welcomed, and capable of success, regardless of linguistic background. I want them to experience Spanish not as isolated vocabulary lists, but as a living connection to people, histories, stories, landscapes, and identities across the world. This belief is reflected in every unit I design, from celebrating Día de los Muertos to studying Andean textiles, cumbia rhythms, Caribbean traditions, and Indigenous continuity. My love of history enriches these lessons, helping students see that cultures evolve, languages travel, and traditions carry meaning across generations.
          </p>

          <p>
            My graduate studies in the MATL program have strengthened this foundation and expanded the theoretical lens through which I understand teaching. I have learned to analyze language teaching not only as a set of classroom routines but as an intellectually rich, research-grounded discipline. Gass, Behney, and Plonsky (2020) helped me understand interlanguage development and the role of input, noticing, and interaction. Brown (2014) emphasized the emotional and human dimensions of learning, the importance of affective variables, motivation, and confidence-building. Walsh (2011) taught me to analyze the dynamics of classroom talk: the wait time I provide, the questions I ask, the feedback I give, and the opportunities for student interaction that I create. These texts, paired with my own teaching experiences, have transformed how I plan and facilitate each lesson.
          </p>

          <p>
            I now intentionally create comprehensible, multimodal input, build routines around movement and music, integrate inquiry-based tasks, and design activities that encourage communication even at novice levels. I use visuals, gestures, pacing adjustments, scaffolds, and repetition in meaningful contexts. I have become more mindful of when I recast, when I clarify, and how I guide students toward accuracy without discouraging their willingness to communicate. I understand more deeply the role of translanguaging, identity, and culturally sustaining pedagogy in world language teaching.
          </p>

          <p>
            My love of history guides me here as well. Understanding the historical roots of language variation allows me to explain cultural perspectives, regional expressions, and the diversity of the Spanish-speaking world. My goal is for students to experience Spanish class as a window into human history and as an invitation to engage with the world as global citizens.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also learned that students bring their full selves into the classroom, their languages, their cultures, and their lived experiences. As a teacher of young heritage learners, English-dominant students, and multilingual newcomers, I recognize the importance of honoring this linguistic diversity. My own multilingual journey helps me empathize with students who are learning English, students beginning Spanish for the first time, and students navigating multiple languages at home and school.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my classroom, Spanish is not simply a subject to be memorized; it is a tool for connection, curiosity, and creativity. Whether students are acting out stories, interpreting medieval songs, analyzing cultural artifacts, or singing traditional music, they are actively engaging with culture in meaningful, developmentally appropriate ways.
          </p>

          <p>
            My teaching philosophy has evolved into one that is culturally sustaining, inquiry-based, historically grounded, and focused on real communication. I want students to develop not only linguistic proficiency but also intercultural competence, to ask questions, explore perspectives, compare practices, and appreciate the richness of the Spanish-speaking world across time. I believe deeply in the ACTFL 5 Cs because they mirror my own experiences as a learner: Communication, Cultures, Connections, Comparisons, and Communities guide my instructional choices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, my love of reading, my love of languages, and my lifelong love of history have shaped the teacher I am today. Language opened doors for me, socially, academically, and professionally, and I want to open those same doors for my students. Every smile during a song, every brave attempt at speaking, every cultural discovery, and every historical connection reminds me why I chose this path. My classroom is a place where stories matter, history lives, language is celebrated, and every child has the opportunity to build confidence in their voice and identity. As I continue growing in my profession, I remain committed to teaching Spanish with joy, empathy, rigor, and cultural depth.
