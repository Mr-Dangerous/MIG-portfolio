          <h2>Self-Assessment of Language Proficiency (ACTFL Guidelines)</h2>
          <p>
            As part of my professional reflection for the MATL program, I conducted a self-assessment of my Spanish proficiency using the ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines (2024). As a native Spanish speaker from Spain, my proficiency has been shaped by lifelong personal, academic, and professional experiences, as well as the demands of teaching Spanish to elementary learners. Below, I describe my abilities across the four skill areas: Interpretive Listening, Interpretive Reading, Interpersonal Communication, and Presentational Speaking/Writing, using ACTFL terminology to reflect my current level of performance and areas for continued growth.
          </p>

          <h3>Interpretive Listening: Superior</h3>
          <p>
            As a native Spanish speaker, I can understand speech on a wide range of topics, from informal conversations to academic lectures, professional discussions, and culturally embedded references. According to ACTFL, Superior listeners can follow intricate cultural and linguistic cues, which aligns with my ability to understand regional variations, idiomatic expressions, and fast-paced or unscripted speech. This strength supports my ability to provide comprehensible input to learners and to adjust my speech appropriately during instruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            My listening skills also include recognizing dialectal differences across the Spanish-speaking world, which allows me to engage with diverse speakers accurately and respectfully. This proficiency is not only personally meaningful but also pedagogically valuable. It enables me to select authentic listening materials for my students and to scaffold them effectively so learners can access real-world Spanish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because I can comprehend such a broad range of spoken Spanish, I can provide rich and comprehensible input that adapts to students' needs. I can model clear, natural language, adjust my rate of speech, simplify or expand explanations, and incorporate culturally meaningful examples during instruction. This ability to modulate my listening and speaking skills supports a more inclusive, responsive, and culturally sustaining classroom environment where all students can engage with authentic language in meaningful ways.
          </p>

          <h3>Interpretive Reading: Superior</h3>
          <p>
            I demonstrate a Superior level of interpretive reading proficiency, allowing me to engage with a broad range of authentic texts, including literary works, academic articles, formal documents, editorials, and historical sources. I can understand nuanced arguments, implied meanings, rhetorical devices, and culturally specific references embedded in complex written discourse. ACTFL's Superior readers are described as capable of analyzing perspectives, evaluating evidence, and synthesizing ideas across texts, abilities that align with my own reading practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my professional work, this proficiency enables me to research cultural and linguistic topics with accuracy and depth, select high-quality authentic materials for classroom instruction, and interpret academic literature that informs my teaching. My advanced comprehension also allows me to adapt or scaffold texts for novice learners by simplifying language, highlighting key structures, and building background knowledge. This skill supports culturally rich instruction and ensures that students at different proficiency levels can access meaningful, developmentally appropriate content. Ultimately, my Superior reading proficiency strengthens my ability to design instruction that is both authentic and comprehensible.
          </p>

          <h3>Interpersonal Communication: Advanced High / Superior</h3>
          <p>
            My interpersonal communication proficiency falls between the Advanced High and Superior levels, allowing me to participate in extended, spontaneous conversations on both familiar and unfamiliar topics. I can narrate and describe in multiple time frames, express opinions, hypothesize, and support ideas with detailed explanations, skills that ACTFL associates with advanced and emerging superior performance. I am also able to handle unexpected complications such as clarifying misunderstandings, negotiating meaning, or adjusting to unfamiliar registers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In classroom settings, these skills translate into my ability to adjust my speech to meet students where they are linguistically. I can shift from simplified target-language input for novice learners to natural, idiomatic speech when interacting with heritage speakers or colleagues. I use strategies such as circumlocution, clarification questions, and visual or contextual scaffolds when learners experience difficulty. Additionally, I maintain culturally appropriate interactional norms, such as turn-taking, conversational politeness strategies, and pragmatic alignment, so students are exposed not just to the language but also to the cultural practices embedded within it. This flexibility strengthens students' confidence and supports a communicatively rich classroom environment.
          </p>

          <h3>Presentational Speaking: Superior</h3>
          <p>
            My presentational speaking proficiency is at the Superior level, which allows me to deliver organized and coherent explanations, academic content, cultural presentations, and storytelling in Spanish with precision and clarity. I can discuss complex ideas, justify viewpoints, make predictions, and weave in historical or cultural references, all of which align with ACTFL's description of Superior-level performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my teaching practice, this proficiency allows me to design and deliver developmentally appropriate lessons for young learners while maintaining linguistic accuracy. I can adjust my speech for comprehensibility, strategically incorporating gestures, visuals, examples, and pacing to support novice and intermediate students. My Superior presentational ability also extends to professional contexts, such as parent meetings, team collaborations, and academic presentations, where I communicate in Spanish with confidence and cultural awareness. This level of skill ensures that my instructional language is both rich and accessible, modeling strong language use for students while maintaining clarity.
          </p>

          <h3>Presentational Writing: Advanced High / Superior</h3>
          <p>
            My presentational writing proficiency is consistently Advanced High, with features of Superior. I can produce extended, well-organized texts across a range of genres, including lesson plans, academic reflections, instructional materials, cultural analyses, and formal communications. My writing demonstrates control of complex structures, a strong vocabulary range, and the ability to express abstract or sophisticated ideas, characteristics associated with advanced-level writing. According to ACTFL, Advanced High writers may still show occasional limitations in precision or stylistic control in highly specialized or abstract genres, which aligns with my continued growth in academic and research-based writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, this proficiency allows me to design high-quality instructional materials, create clear guidance for families, articulate cultural and linguistic concepts for students, and complete graduate-level coursework. I am able to adapt written language for diverse audiences, from young learners to academic readers, adjusting register, tone, and structure as needed. My strong writing skills support clear communication and contribute to a classroom environment where students are exposed to accurate, culturally informed, and pedagogically meaningful written Spanish.
          </p>

          <h3>Reflection and Future Goals</h3>
          <p>
            While my Spanish proficiency is high across all domains, the ACTFL framework encourages continual growth. My goals moving forward include: Further developing my academic writing skills for professional publications, increasing my knowledge of regional linguistic variations to diversify classroom exposure, and continuing to expand culturally responsive practices by integrating authentic materials from a wider range of Spanish-speaking communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            This self-assessment confirms that my proficiency supports my role as a Spanish educator and allows me to serve as an effective model of the language for my students, while also identifying areas for ongoing professional growth, one of the reasons I decided to enroll in the MATL program, and continue my growth as a Spanish teacher.
